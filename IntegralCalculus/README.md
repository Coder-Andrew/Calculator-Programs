# Approximate Integration Programs

## Steps to use:
1. Go to functions menu via the `Y=` key
2. Input the function you want to approximately integrate into `Y1`
3. Select the method/function you want to use
4. Input bounds of integration and number of steps (a is lower bound, b is upper bound)
5. Input number of steps and press enter
6. The answer will be displayed on your calculator
7. You can view the intermediate calculations using the through the list editor in the `STAT` menu

### Notes:
- Remeber that the technique you use will give an underestimate/overestimate based on the function you are integrating
- `L1` are your function inputs
- `L2` are your function outputs
- `L3` are your function outputs with scalar multiples applied (depending on which technique you are using)
- You can change your calculators settings through the `MODE` menu to display fractions (you will need to rerun the calculations)
- Simpson's Rule requires an even `N`
